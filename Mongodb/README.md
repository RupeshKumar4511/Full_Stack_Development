# Introduction :
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently and provides high flexibility compared to traditional relational databases.

# Key Features of MongoDB
Document-Oriented :
<br>
Stores data in JSON-like BSON format.
Each document has a flexible schema, unlike SQL databases with rigid structures.
<br>
NoSQL Database:
<br>
Does not use tables, rows, or fixed schemas like relational databases.
Uses collections and documents instead.
<br>
Scalability:
<br>
Supports horizontal scaling using sharding, distributing data across multiple servers.
<br>

Indexing :
<br>
Automatically creates indexes for faster queries.
Supports various types of indexing (e.g., compound, geospatial).
<br>
Replication & High Availability
<br>
Uses Replica Sets for data redundancy and automatic failover.
Aggregation Framework

Performs complex queries, transformations, and analytics like SQL's GROUP BY.
<br>
ACID Transactions :
<br>
Supports multi-document transactions, ensuring data consistency.
<br>
Flexible Schema :
<br>
Allows dynamic, semi-structured data storage, unlike relational databases.

# Important Point 
Database -> Collections -> Documents 
<br>
Cluster : A cluster in MongoDB is a group of connected servers (nodes) that work together to store and manage data. It helps distribute data, improve performance, and ensure high availability.

# GridFS 
GridFS (Grid File System) is MongoDBâ€™s built-in file storage system used to store and retrieve large files like images, videos, and documents directly inside MongoDB. It splits large files into smaller chunks and stores them as separate documents.
